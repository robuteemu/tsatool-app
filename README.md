*Under construction!*

This will be a [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) app for analyzing Finnish road weather station (TieSääAsema) data. Data will be located and handled in a [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) database.

To get familiar with road weather station data models and properties, see the documentation for the [real time API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/tieliikenne/).

Autogenerated HTML docs can be found in `docs/build/html/py-modindex.html`, but the documentation is currently badly formatted and not complete.
