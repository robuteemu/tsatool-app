# tsatool-app (311386)

*Under construction!*

This will be a [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) app for analyzing Finnish road weather station (TieSääAsema) data. Data will be located and handled in a [Timescale](https://www.timescale.com/) database.

To get familiar with road weather station data models and properties, see the documentation for the [real time API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/tieliikenne/).

Autogenerated HTML docs can be found in `docs/build/html/py-modindex.html`, but the documentation is currently badly formatted and not complete.

# Installation

Make sure you have the following stuff installed. Commands needed for the Ubuntu server are given accordingly.

- Python 3.X. The server should have Python 3.6 installed by default.
- Python package management tool such as **pip** or **conda**; install the packages in `requirements.txt` by using this. Server: `sudo apt install python-pip`
- PostgreSQL 9.6 at least; could be 10.X or 11.X as well, but using this so far. Server: `sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib` will install 10.6.
- [TimescaleDB](https://docs.timescale.com/v1.2/getting-started/installation), select the one for your system and the PostgreSQL version you've installed. Server: follow the instructions on [TimescaleDB site](https://docs.timescale.com/v1.2/getting-started/installation/ubuntu/installation-apt-ubuntu)

Installing these / checking whether the required installations exist may be built into a script in future, but for now these are to be done manually as the software will not be distributed widely.
