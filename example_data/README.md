# Example input data

`toimiva.xlsx` contains one sheet only,
and it should result in a clean analysis run.

`virheita.xlsx` contains various errors
and can be used to test error handling and as a reference on how not to write input data.

CSV versions cannot be used as input files,
they are here just to provide quick GitHub-readable versions of the respective Excel files.
